- Likeable model can has Likes and Dislikes.
- Likes and Dislikes for one model are mutually exclusive.
- Get Likeable models ordered by likes count.

- Following PHP Standard Recommendations:
  - [PSR-1 (Basic Coding Standard)](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/).
  - [PSR-2 (Coding Style Guide)](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/).
  - [PSR-4 (Autoloading Standard)](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/).
- Covered with unit tests.

## Installation

First, pull in the package through Composer.

```sh
$ composer require turahe/laravel-likeable
```

**If you are using Laravel 5.5 you can skip register package part.** 

#### Register package on Laravel 5.4 and lower

Include the service provider within `app/config/app.php`.

```php
'providers' => [
    Turahe\Likeable\LikeableServiceProvider::class,
],
```

#### Perform Database Migration

At last, you need to publish and run database migrations.

```sh
$ php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Turahe\Likeable\Providers\LikeableServiceProvider" --tag=migrations
$ php artisan migrate
```

## Usage

### Prepare likeable model

Use `Likeable` contract in model which will get likes behavior and implement it or just use `Likeable` trait. 

```php
use Turahe\Likeable\Contracts\Likeable as LikeableContract;
use Turahe\Likeable\Traits\Likeable;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Article extends Model implements LikeableContract
{
    use Likeable;
}
```

### Available methods

$article->unlike(); // current user
$article->unlike($user->id);
```

##### Toggle like mark of model

```php
$article->likeToggle(); // current user
$article->likeToggle($user->id);
```

##### Get model likes count

```php
$article->likesCount;
```

##### Get model likes counter

```php
$article->likesCounter;
```

##### Get likes relation

```php
$article->likes();
```

##### Get iterable `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection` of existing model likes

```php
$article->likes;
```

##### Boolean check if user liked model

```php
$article->liked; // current user
$article->liked(); // current user
$article->liked($user->id);
```

*Checks in eager loaded relations `likes` & `likesAndDislikes` first.*

##### Get collection of users who liked model

$article->collectLikers();

```

#### Dislikes

```php
$article->dislikesCount;
```

##### Get model dislikes counter

```php
$article->dislikesCounter;
```

##### Get dislikes relation

```php
$article->dislikes();
```

##### Get iterable `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection` of existing model dislikes

```php
$article->dislikes;
```

##### Boolean check if user disliked model

```php
$article->disliked; // current user
$article->disliked(); // current user
$article->disliked($user->id);
```

*Checks in eager loaded relations `dislikes` & `likesAndDislikes` first.*

```php
$article->collectDislikers();
```

##### Delete all dislikes for model

```php

```

##### Get iterable `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection` of existing model likes and dislikes

```php
$article->likesAndDislikes;
```

### Scopes

##### Find all articles liked by user

```php
Article::whereLikedBy($user->id)
    ->with('likesCounter') // Allow eager load (optional)
    ->get();
```

##### Find all articles disliked by user

```php
Article::whereDislikedBy($user->id)
    ->with('dislikesCounter') // Allow eager load (optional)
    ->get();
```

##### Fetch Likeable models by likes count

```php
$sortedArticles = Article::orderByLikesCount()->get();
$sortedArticles = Article::orderByLikesCount('asc')->get();
```

```sh
$ likeable:recount
```

##### Recount likes and dislikes of concrete model type (using morph map alias)

```sh
$ likeable:recount --model="article"
```

##### Recount likes and dislikes of concrete model type (using fully qualified class name)

```sh
$ likeable:recount --model="App\Models\Article"
```

##### Recount only likes of all model types

```sh
$ likeable:recount --type="like"
```

##### Recount only likes of concrete model type (using morph map alias)

```sh
$ likeable:recount --model="article" --type="like"
```

##### Recount only likes of concrete model type (using fully qualified class name)

```sh
$ likeable:recount --model="App\Models\Article" --type="like"

```sh
$ likeable:recount --type="dislike"
```

##### Recount only dislikes of concrete model type (using morph map alias)

##### Recount only dislikes of concrete model type (using fully qualified class name)

```sh
$ likeable:recount --model="App\Models\Article" --type="dislike"
```

## Extending

You can override core classes of package with your own implementations:

- `Models\Like`
- `Models\LikeCounter`
- `Services\LikeableService`

*Note: Don't forget that all custom models must implement original models interfaces.*

To make it you should use container [binding interfaces to implementations](https://laravel.com/docs/master/container#binding-interfaces-to-implementations) in your application service providers.

##### Use model class own implementation

```php
$this->app->bind(
    \Turahe\Likeable\Contracts\Like::class,
    \App\Models\CustomLike::class
);
```

##### Use service class own implementation

```php
$this->app->singleton(
    \Turahe\Likeable\Contracts\LikeableService::class,
    \App\Services\CustomService::class
);
```

After that your `CustomLike` and `CustomService` classes will be instantiable with helper method `app()`.

```php
$model = app(\Turahe\Likeable\Contracts\Like::class);
$service = app(\Turahe\Likeable\Contracts\LikeableService::class);
```
